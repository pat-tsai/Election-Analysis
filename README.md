# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
In the exercises building up to this challenge, we were instructed to create code that would calculate total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates participating, votes and percentage of votes each candidate received, and determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. In this challenge, we were instructed to add additional functionality to the existing code, including voter turnout from each county, percentage of each votes from each county, and county with highest turnout.
